CHANGELOG
----------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2 (03-14-2013)

  - Added IOSystem/IOStream support, allowing for custom IO handling. An IOSystem can be registered to an AssimpImporter,
  which is used during ImportFile and ConvertFile APIs. It currently is not supported for ImportFileFromStream APIs.
  - Fixed marshalling of String material property values
  - Fixed aiGetTexture function signature to take in an array of 2 UV wrapmodes

3.1 (01-01-2013)

  - Added AnyCPU support, replaced AssimpMethods with AssimpLibrary that dynamically loads/unloads the unmanaged Assimp DLL
  optionally, a custom file path can be specified to load the Assimp DLL. By default, the 32 or 64 bit Assimp DLL is loaded from the
  same directory that the AssimpNet DLL is located in, depending on the bitness of the process.
  
  - Added missing properties for PreState/PostState in NodeAnimationChannel
